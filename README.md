# osm_items_to_url
Not really generic code, but probably reusable as an exemple for similar applications.

I produced this code in 2013, in a rush, to be able tom summary various potential renting locations ("appartments", aka apparts) from various sites onto an OSM map using leaflet.

As is, need much refactoring to make it cleaner and more generic
